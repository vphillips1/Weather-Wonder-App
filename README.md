# Weather-Wonder-App

### Created a weather app to show the weather depending on the specific city/location. Using a Weather API, I was able to create a model class, Service, Controller, and View to display the data from the API. The application is still a work in progress.

### Eventually I will like the user to enter the name of the city and pull the weather for that particular city they are interested in. It will make it more user friendly.
